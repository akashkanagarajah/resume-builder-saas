Resume Builder SaaS

A lightweight React + Vite application that lets users upload resumes (PDF), preview them in-browser, extract raw text using pdfjs-dist, and automatically detect important keywords. Built with TailwindCSS for a clean UI and react-dropzone for a smooth drag-and-drop experience. Matched keywords are displayed visually under the uploaded resume for easy review.
